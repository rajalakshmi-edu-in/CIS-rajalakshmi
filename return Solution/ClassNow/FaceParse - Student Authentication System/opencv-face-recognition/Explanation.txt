This is the main module. As you can see there are three major files.

i)extract_embeddings.py
ii)train_model.py
iii)recognize.py

i) What this basically does is, there are all the datasets labelled and stored in the dataset folder. This extracts the important facial data from the files.
ii) The data that has been extracted is then trained into the neural network so that the computer knows whos who.
iii)This file is to basically look via the camera and see if the face matches anything.
